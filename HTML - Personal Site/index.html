    <td><h1>Josh Marzano</h1>
    <p><em>Teacher of English at <strong><a href="https://www.ihmadrid.com/">International House Madrid</a></strong>.</em></p>
    <p>My name is Josh Marzano, and I will be a first-year English teacher at International House Madrid starting this September. I hold a BA in Spanish and Women's and Gender Studies from the University of Miami, as well as an MA in Spanish and Latin
      American Linguistic, Literary and Cultural Studies from NYU Madrid. If you had asked me a few years ago, I would never have thought I would want to be an English teacher in Spain; the original plan was to teach Spanish in the United States.
      However, I moved to Spain immediately after graduating from university and became enamored of the Spanish lifestyle (and cost of living). Therefore, I decided to stay.</p></td>
